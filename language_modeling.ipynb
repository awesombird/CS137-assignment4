In particular, you should implement the [Transformer encoder](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/transformer.html), but you need to turn on the causal flag in the forward calculation. Please check the documentation of `MultiheadAttention`. Note that the books states GPT as transformer decoder, but it is essentially the encoder with the causal flag on. \n",

Your work is really similar to this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html), so please read this tutorial carefully. However, there are two differences you may want to keep in mind. First, we do character-level language modeling. Second, you CANNOT use a Transformer model from Torch directly. Therefore, you can best use the idea in the tutorial if you have a good understanding of it.  \n",
